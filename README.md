# Cash Register App

This is cash register app made using vanilla JS. It is used to know how much change we have to return to the customer. We need to type the bill amount and then input the cash we will give. The cash register then provide the change to return with minimum number of notes.

1. Also added the negative Bill Amount Validation, It will show an error if negative or zero bill amount is typed & not allow to add the cash amount.
2. If Cash given is less tha Bill Amount it will show an error that Cash Amount should be greater than bill amount.
